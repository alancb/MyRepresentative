# Stretch Problem - My Representative

A simple application that gets a list of representatives by zip code.

### Step One

Using the API reference at whoismyrepresentative.com, build an app with a main view that lets me input a zip code, and a detail view that displays a list of the representatives for that zip code. Present the detail view after retrieving the search results.

Time: 60m

#### Black Diamonds:

Allow me to tap on the representative to call his or her office.

#### Hints:
* Consider how you will handle presenting the detail view. Do you present immediately? If so, how will you reload the tableview when the results arrive? Do you wait to present? If so, how do you let the user know that the search is happening?
